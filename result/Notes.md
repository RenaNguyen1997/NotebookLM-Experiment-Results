# TEST FOR NOTES FUNCTIONALITY

### **Objective**

Given that notes are a powerful tool within NotebookLM, it is essential to assess their effectiveness in organizing and synthesizing information to create concise paragraphs. Additionally, we will explore how new users can make the most of the suggested actions available in the notes feature

## **Method**

In this experiment, 1-2 sections will be randomly selected from each source to create notes. Following the selection process, we will test NotebookLM's ability to suggest relevant actions for each note, as well as for multiple notes simultaneously.

The results will be analyzed to address the following key questions:

-	Does the summarization function produce a clear and accurate brief?
-	Are the notebook guides generated automatically and effectively assist users in navigating their notes?

**Thematic Outline: Customer Acquisition and Retention in E-commerce**

1. Understanding Customer Value & Segmentation

*RFM Analysis: 
Measuring customer value based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

**Metrics:**
a) Recency: Time since last purchase ("DaySinceLastOrder").
b) Frequency: Total number of purchases ("OrderCount").
c) Monetary Value: Total amount spent (proxied by "cashback").

* Customer Segmentation:
  
  - Identifying high-value customers based on RFM analysis and other relevant factors.
  - It is important to focus acquisition efforts on high-value customer segments.

2. Effective Customer Acquisition Strategies
* Focus on Long-Term Value:
  - Prioritizing sustainable revenue and customer lifetime value over short-term trial numbers.
  - Avoiding unsustainable discounts that attract low-value customers.
    
* Targeted Approach:
  - Utilizing tailored offers designed for specific customer segments with high potential.
  - Moving away from generic discounts that attract a broad, less valuable customer base.
  
3. The Importance of Customer Retention

* Quality Over Quantity:
  
  - Addressing customer churn by acquiring the right customers, particularly high-value ones.
  - Recognizing that a high churn rate can negate the benefits of high initial acquisition numbers.

* Limitations of Open Offers:
  
  - Open offers often fail to attract enough high-value customers to offset attrition.
  - This can harm long-term profitability even if initial trial numbers seem positive.
  
4. Integrating Acquisition and Retention

* Shifting Focus from Trials to Repurchase:
  - Moving beyond simply driving initial trials and focusing on encouraging repeat purchases.
  - Recognizing that true success lies in achieving both high trial and full-price repurchase rates.

* Building a Holistic Strategy:
  - Integrating customer acquisition efforts with robust retention strategies.
  - Ensuring that acquired customers are nurtured and encouraged to become repeat buyers.

5. The Growing Landscape of E-commerce

* Definition: 
Buying and selling goods and services over the Internet.

* Benefits:
  
  - Speed and convenience for customers.
  - Expanded market reach for businesses.
  - Increased competitiveness for businesses.

* Implications: 
The growth of e-commerce necessitates effective online customer acquisition and retention strategies.
