# TESTING THE COLLABORATION FUNCTIONALITY

### **Objective**

The main goal is to explore the different levels of collaboration provided by NotebookLM and recommend the most suitable option for various scenarios.

---

### **Method**

Two levels of collaboration will be tested: Viewer and Editor.

One notebook will be used, along with two additional accounts. One account will receive the shared file in Viewer mode, while the other will receive it in Editor mode.

Both accounts will perform basic tasks within the notebook, including:

- Uploading additional sources
- Accessing existing sources
- Asking questions
- Creating notes
- Performing questions and other activities on the notes

The results will be analyzed to examine the differences in permissions and the ease of performing tasks under each mode.

**3. Viewer access**

- Accessing the resources is the same, but you cannot upload or make changes to the existing sources

- The functionality for working on notes and paragraphs also varies between modes. While features such as understanding complex paragraphs and suggesting related ideas remain available, users in Viewer mode cannot create or add new notes.

  *Specifically, when selecting an existing note, there is an additional action called **critique**. Although members cannot modify the notes, they can leave comments, facilitating real-time conversations between the owner and members when necessary*.
