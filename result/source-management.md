# Experiment 1: Source Management Functionality
### **Objectives** 
Test the ability of NotebookLM to upload and read different types of sources

---

### **Method** 
3 different files will be uploaded via 3 different methods

- Google Docs:
- PDF: 
- Parsed text:

The experiment is carried out to answer the following questions: 
- If the file has been well recognized with simple questions
- If the graphs, pictures, and tables are well-recognized
- After updating the Google Docs, can we see the updating request?
- If the Google Docs file is updated accordingly once the update request

---

### **Result**

After clicking on a source, NotebookLM automatically generates a summary and suggests key themes that accurately reflect the research content. This feature allows users to quickly understand the main ideas and themes within their sources. All three sources demonstrate consistent performance, delivering high-quality results

1. *Google Docs:*  To automatically sync data between Google Docs on Drive and files in NotebookLM, users can easily find the sync option in the top left corner of the canvas. The syncing process is smooth and seamless, ensuring that any updates made in Google Docs are reflected in NotebookLM without any hassle. Furthermore, I selected a research paper that included pictures and diagrams. It was evident that NotebookLM reads the images and diagrams effectively, accurately reflecting all necessary components while preserving the original formats.

3. *Parsed text:*  A section of the text containing a table was selected to evaluate NotebookLM's ability to read files with tables. NotebookLM provides strong support for table formats, effectively handling even tables with complex formatting from the original version.

3. *PDF:*  NotebookLM correctly reads all the text content; however, it struggles to read and upload the formatting, figures, and charts accurately. Furthermore, NotebookLM can only recognize files created directly in Google Docs. Files uploaded from a local machine with .docs format are not recognized. Users must save their files as Google Docs to utilize the functionality properly.
