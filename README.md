# NotebookLM Experiment Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the results and data from experiments conducted with NotebookLM, an experimental product developed by Google that leverages language model capabilities for enhanced research and learning experiences. The experiments aim to evaluate the functionalities of NotebookLM, test its capabilities, and observe its performance in various scenarios.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **data/**: This folder contains all the data used during the experiments, including uploaded documents, text files, and any relevant datasets. Each file is labeled for easy identification and access.

2. **results/**: This folder records the results and observations from each experiment. It includes summaries of the experiments, screenshots, and any findings that highlight the performance of NotebookLM. Each experiment is documented in separate markdown files for clarity.
